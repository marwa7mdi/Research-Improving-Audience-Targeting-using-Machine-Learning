## ðŸ“„ Abstract
This research introduces a multitask learning model enhanced with an attention mechanism to accurately predict sequential online user behaviors such as clicks and conversions. By leveraging a 1D-CNN tower for click prediction and an attention-enhanced fully-connected tower for conversion, the model outperforms existing baselines in click-through and conversion rates, effectively improving audience targeting capabilities :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
